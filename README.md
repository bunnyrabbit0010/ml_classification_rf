This project applies machine learning to personal health data captured by Apple devices (Apple Watch and iPhone) to predict the type of workout a user is likely to perform. The goal is to use historical patterns and activity signals (like duration, distance, energy, time of day, etc.) to accurately infer future workout behavior.
